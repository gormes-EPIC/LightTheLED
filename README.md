## Your Task: Complete Survival Mode or Hardcore Mode

1. **Survival Mode** is best for students who are new to Raspberry Pis and circuits. This is the best fit for most students. 
2. **Hardcore Mode** is best for students who are already familiar with Raspberry Pi's or have taken Introduction to Electronics at EPIC before.

## Getting Started: Survival Mode

1. For this project, you will use Python to light an LED with your Raspberry Pi.
2. First you will determine which resistor using **Ohm's Law**. Ohm's law states $V = IR$.
	1. $V$ represents **voltage** and is measured in volts($V$). $I$ represents **current** and is measured in amps($A$). $R$ represents **resistance** and is measured in Ohms($\Omega$).
	2. We trying to solve for required resistance(which we will apply with a resistor), so reorganize the function to solve for resistance. 
	3. Next, the voltage through the function is equal to $V_{supply} - V_{forward}$. Replace $V$ in the function with  $V_{supply} - V_{forward}$.
	4. The $V_{supply}$ provided by the GPIO pins is 3.3V. 
	5. Research 5mm LED's to find their forward voltage and safe current. Then plug the values into your function. Remember to convert to volts and amps!
	6. Solve for resistance to find the required resistor. You must select a resistor with **the resistance you solved for or greater** or your LED will explode. 
	7. Check your work with Ormes before moving forward.
3. Use the above resources, to build your circuit. Connect the light to pin 18. It should look like the picture below.
	- **Warning!** The following could permanently damage your Pi if you do not heed the warnings below.
		- Turn off your Pi when connecting cables to the GPIO ports.
		- Use a resistor, the LED will consumer as much voltage as it can (and explode!). This may damage your Pi, you or your classmates.
		- Do not bend the GPIO pins. Once placing your T-Cobbler onto the Pi, you should not remove it.

4. Open the folder you created during the last lab and create a new file `light.py`. Use the resources above to write a program to turn on pin 18 (which should turn on your light, if wired correctly). Your program should turn the light on, wait a few seconds, then turn the light off.
5. When you are done, take a video of your LED lighting up. Then upload your video and your code to GitHub.

## Getting Started: Hardcore Mode

1. For this project, you will use **Python and the terminal** to light an LED with your Raspberry Pi.
2. First you will determine which resistor using **Ohm's Law**. Ohm's law states $V = IR$.
	1. $V$ represents **voltage** and is measured in volts($V$). $I$ represents **current** and is measured in amps($A$). $R$ represents **resistance** and is measured in Ohms($\Omega$).

5. When you are done, take a video of your LED lighting up. Then upload your video and your code to GitHub. 
6. Then, figure out how to use the **terminal only** to light the LED. Add the instructions to do so to your GitHub README. See the resources below for additional help. 

- [ ] Upload your video and your code to GitHub

## Deliverables

- Answer the following questions either in person or in a written format:  
	- What is the purpose of breadboard? 
	- Does the LED orientation matter (cathode & abode)? 
	- Why do you put a resistor in your circuit?
	- How will a resistor with greater resistance affect the light?
